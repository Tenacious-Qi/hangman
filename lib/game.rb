        Welcome to Hangman!

        A secret word has been generated at random.
        Try to guess the letters of the secret word.
        You may guess the entire word at any time.
        If a letter guess is correct, 
        game will show where that letter occurs in the word.

        You will only have a few tries before the man is hanged!
        
        If at any time you'd like to save your progress,
        type SAVE instead of guessing a letter.
        
        Good luck!
