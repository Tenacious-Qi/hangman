        Hello, hangman enthusiast!

        What would you like to do?
        
        Enter [1] to start a new game
        Enter [2] to load a saved game
        Enter [3] to save current game
        Enter [4] to exit current game

        Welcome to Hangman!

        A secret word has been generated at random.
        *Try to guess the letters of the secret word.*
        *You may guess the entire word at any time.*
        If a letter guess is correct, 
        game will show where that letter occurs in the word.
        You will only have a few tries before the man is hanged!
        
        At any time, instead of guessing, you have these options: 

          Enter [1] to start a new game
          Enter [2] to load a saved game
          Enter [3] to save current game
          Enter [4] to exit current game

        Good luck!
        
    HEREDOC
