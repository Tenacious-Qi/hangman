A word 5 to 12 letters long is selected at random from a text file dictionary. 
Number of guesses allowed = (the length of the word * 2), e.g. a 10 letter word allows 20 tries to win the game. Option to guess entire word instead of letter by letter. At any time, unless player is loading a saved game, player can: 1) start a new game, 2) load a saved game, 3) save game, or 4) exit by entering 1, 2, 3, or 4 respectively.
